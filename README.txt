This project written with Python 2.7

In order to run the code only type:

python main.py

Requirements:

You need to put Dataset folder under main directory(put where main.py exists).

Code is written by the assumption of that you are giving all dataset, not partial. This is crucial
for the health of code :D. Otherwise, it'll give you uncorrect results. (I assumed the docID's are consecutive starting from the first document.)
